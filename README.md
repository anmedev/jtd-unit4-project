## Description
This repository contains my code for the Unit 4 project in the Treehouse Java Techdegree curriculum. This project uses Java, Spark, the Handlebars templating engine, HTML, and CSS to create a blog site. Users have the ability to add blog entries, edit existing entries, as well as add comments on blog entries. The blog site also includes an authentication feature that only grants admin users permission to add and edit blog entries.

## Known Bugs
12/16/24: The detail pages currently feature the following bugs: the content for the individual blog entries is not displaying and the "Edit Entry" hyperlink and Comments form are leading to an error. The "Create" button isn't redirecting properly after the user is authenticated. I'm in the process of resolving these issues.
